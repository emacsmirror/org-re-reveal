* What is this?
  - [[https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#multiplexing][Multiplexing]]
    means that your audience views your presentation on their devices
    - State of your presentation mirrored on their devices
  - Three ingredients
    1. You control the /master/ presentation
    2. Publicly accessible URL for /client/ presentations
    3. Publicly accessible socket.io server to distribute master events to clients

* Instructions
** Basic setup
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Please follow instructions in
     [[https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#multiplexing][README of reveal.js]]
   - Obtain your own socketID and secret and use them as in header of
     this presentation
   - Point audience to URL of client presentation
     - Replace ~.html~ to obtain client URL: ~_client.html~
       - Maybe generate with ~org-re-reveal-publish-to-reveal-client~
         (see [[*GitLab CI for client presentation][GitLab CI for client presentation]]
         below)
       - (Or export with ~C-c C-e v v~ as usual, which generates
         client and master presentations)

** Presentation in Git?
   - Obviously, you should not publish the master presentation
     containing the secret
     - Otherwise, your audience might use the master URL and mess with
       your presentation
     - My approach
       - Use separate file, say ~private/secret.org~
         - Add ~private~ to ~.gitignore~
         - Add ~#+REVEAL_MULTIPLEX_SECRET:
           0815...~ to file ~private/secret.org~
         - In presentation, replace ~#+REVEAL_MULTIPLEX_SECRET:
           0815...~ with ~#+INCLUDE: "private/secret.org"~

*** GitLab CI for client presentation
    - Publish presentations with
      [[https://gitlab.com/oer/emacs-reveal][emacs-reveal]]
      as GitLab Pages
      - In ~.gitlab-ci.yml~ create bogus secret in ~before_script~:

        - ~mkdir private~
        - ~"echo '#+REVEAL_MULTIPLEX_SECRET: 42' > private/secret.org"~
          - Note quotation marks above
      - Use ~org-re-reveal-publish-to-reveal-client~ to publish client
        presentation
        - See
          [[https://gitlab.com/oer/org-re-reveal/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml][.gitlab-ci.yml]]
          that generates this presentation
        - Or alternative [[https://gitlab.com/lechten/talks-2019b/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml][.gitlab-ci.yml]]

*** Local master presentation
    - Generate master presentation locally
      - Present with Firefox from local file system
        - This works with multiplexing and speaker notes
          - (May need to set ~security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy~ to
            ~false~ if local fonts are refused; use separate profile then)
          - Without ~node~ installation mentioned in README of reveal.js
